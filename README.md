Description: A software for counting paper ballots was created where input would be the form of a image of a ballot. This ballot would have a voters preference on the it.
This image would be scanned using OCR and the data stored in an array. After all the ballots would recorded the polling stations would close and counting would began. 
This would continue until the winner would be calculated. 

This was done in my Final Year Project and has a lot to be improved on. Apologies for lack of comments. To be young and naive...
